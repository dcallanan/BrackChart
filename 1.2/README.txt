From this version forward all features are implemented correctly and can now work in different situations.

Changes:
 - You can now customize flags with images or arrays of horizontal hex colors instead of using the default flags which were specific to our projects and would not be useful to you.
 - You can now customize paddingX, paddingY and lineWidth without any bugs using the BrackChartConfig object.
